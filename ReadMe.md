# Intent Examiner

I wrote this to better understand how Android's Intent system works.  It started out as a very simple app to show an intent's contents. I added several random features as I discovered them and wanted to experiment.  Some of those features seemed useful to me, and that is how I ended up with what I have now.  I have tried adding extra features, but, so far, this seems to be the most useful version.

## Installation

I just cloned the repo, opened it as a project in Android Studio, and hit run.
